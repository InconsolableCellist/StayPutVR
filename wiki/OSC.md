## ðŸ“¡ OSC Integration

StayPutVR integrates with VRChat and other OSC-compatible applications. The system supports both incoming commands (to control locking) and outgoing status messages (to reflect device states).

The following documentation is crucial for any avatar creator who wishes to make their own integration.

For most users, I strongly recommend using my collar & cuffs prefab, which is available for purchase on Gumroad (and which supports my work!): [foxipso.gumroad.com/l/stayputvr](https://foxipso.gumroad.com/l/stayputvr)

### Device Status Messages (Outgoing)

StayPutVR sends device status updates to indicate the current state of each tracked device:

**Path Format**: `/avatar/parameters/SPVR_{DeviceName}_Status`  
**Value Type**: Integer (0-5)

**Status Values:**
- `0`: **Disabled** - Device is disabled or unknown state
- `1`: **Unlocked** - Device is free to move (Green LED)
- `2`: **Locked Safe** - Device is locked and within safe boundaries (Red LED)
- `3`: **Locked Warning** - Device is locked and in warning zone (Flashing Yellow LED)
- `4`: **Locked Disobedience** - Device is locked and user is disobeying (Flashing Red LED)
- `5`: **Locked Out of Bounds** - Device is locked and completely out of bounds (Blinking White)

### Device Lock Control (Incoming)

Control individual device locking states via OSC:

**Default Paths:**
- `/avatar/parameters/SPVR_HMD_Latch_IsPosed`
- `/avatar/parameters/SPVR_ControllerLeft_Latch_IsPosed`
- `/avatar/parameters/SPVR_ControllerRight_Latch_IsPosed`
- `/avatar/parameters/SPVR_FootLeft_Latch_IsPosed`
- `/avatar/parameters/SPVR_FootRight_Latch_IsPosed`
- `/avatar/parameters/SPVR_Hip_Latch_IsPosed`

**Value Type**: Boolean (true/1 = lock, false/0 = unlock)

### Device Include Control (Incoming)

Toggle whether devices are included in global locking operations:

**Default Paths:**
- `/avatar/parameters/SPVR_HMD_include`
- `/avatar/parameters/SPVR_ControllerLeft_include`
- `/avatar/parameters/SPVR_ControllerRight_include`
- `/avatar/parameters/SPVR_FootLeft_include`
- `/avatar/parameters/SPVR_FootRight_include`
- `/avatar/parameters/SPVR_Hip_include`

**Value Type**: Boolean (true/1 = toggle include state)  
**Behavior**: Sending `true` toggles the device's "Include in Locking" setting

### Global Lock Controls (Incoming)

Control all devices simultaneously:

**Default Paths:**
- `/avatar/parameters/SPVR_Global_Lock` - Lock all included devices
- `/avatar/parameters/SPVR_Global_Unlock` - Unlock all devices

**Value Type**: Boolean (true/1 = activate)

### Supported Device Types

StayPutVR recognizes and can control the following device types:
- **HMD** - Head-mounted display
- **ControllerLeft** - Left hand controller
- **ControllerRight** - Right hand controller  
- **FootLeft** - Left foot tracker
- **FootRight** - Right foot tracker
- **Hip** - Hip/waist tracker

### OSC Configuration

Default OSC settings:
- **Send Port**: 9000 (to VRChat/applications)
- **Receive Port**: 9001 (from VRChat/applications)  
- **Address**: 127.0.0.1 (localhost)

All OSC paths are configurable through the OSC tab in the application interface.
