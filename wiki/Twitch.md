## üí¨ Twitch Integration (experimental)

StayPutVR includes Twitch integration that allows viewers to interact with your VR session through chat commands, donations, subscriptions, and bits. The integration supports both automated responses to Twitch events and real-time chat command processing.

*Because I'm not a Twitch partner I need testers for this feature!*
### üöÄ Quick Setup

1. **Create a Twitch Application**:
   - Go to [dev.twitch.tv/console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console)

  - Plays unlock sound and sends OSC status updates
  - Responds with confirmation message in chat

- **`!status`** - Reports current device and lock status
  - Shows total devices detected
  - Shows how many devices are included in locking
  - Reports current global lock state
  - Shows individual device lock counts

**Example Chat Interaction:**
```
Viewer: !lock
StayPutVRBot: @Viewer Locking devices!

Viewer: !status  
StayPutVRBot: @Viewer StayPutVR Status: 6 devices detected, 4 included in locking, GLOBAL LOCK ACTIVE (4 devices locked)

Viewer: !unlock
StayPutVRBot: @Viewer Unlocking devices!
```

### üéÅ Event-Based Automation
