## ðŸ“¡ PiShock Integration

StayPutVR can send commands to PiShock through its web interface. You just need to provide your username, API key, and share code, available via PiShock's website.

You can configure whether your device beeps, vibrates, or shocks, how long it does so for, how intense it is, and whether it repeats or is one-time only.
